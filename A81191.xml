            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A CURRY-COMB FOR A COCKS-COMB: OR, The Trip to Holland Detected.</head>
            <byline>By the Author of the Trip to <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>AS a true bred <hi>Maſtiff</hi> walks with Patience thro a Country Town, each whifling Cur, in Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Greatneſs, runs Yelping at his heels, till at laſt provoked by the inſolence of ſome forward <hi>Mungril,</hi> who being Ignorant of his <hi>Strength,</hi> and thoughtleſs of his <hi>Courage,</hi> attempts to bite him by the Breech, which occaſions the diſdainful <hi>Animal</hi> to turn back his Head and Grin; and when with <hi>Contempt</hi> he has view'd his feeble Adverſary, he holds up his <hi>Leg</hi> and Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>Piſſes</hi> upon his <hi>Trembling Aſſailant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With as little Concern have I endur'd the Petulent <hi>Snarls,</hi> and envious <hi>Reproaches</hi> of ſome Deminitive <hi>Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> till now, without ſo much as ſhowing them my Teeth.</p>
            <p>But a Scurrilous <hi>Preface,</hi> by an Unmannerly Sauce-box, to a naked piece of <hi>Plagiariſm,</hi> publiſhed under the Title of <hi>A Trip to Holland,</hi> I confeſs hath mov'd me, not only to do my <hi>Self,</hi> but the <hi>World</hi> this Juſtice.</p>
            <p>As for the matter contain'd in his Ill-bred Pamphlet, (ſo very Scandalous by its unſeaſonable Applycation) it is Stolen from Mr. <hi>Feltham</hi> Word for word; and is call'd by him, <hi>Three Weeks Obſervation upon the Low Countrys;</hi> and may be found, annex'd to his <hi>Reſolves,</hi> in any Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers-ſhop in Town.</p>
            <p>Therefore the PUPPY his <hi>Chap</hi> (as his well-bred <hi>Author</hi> calls him in his unſavory <hi>Preface,</hi> which is of a far more Beaſtly Compoſition than his <hi>Dutchman</hi>) might have had ſo much reſpect for his Prince's Country, or that honeſty towards the Publick, and have us'd that manners to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, as not to have ſhow'd himſelf, by his publication of a paultery piece of Bombaſt, ſo very Impudent in the face of Authority, ſo Knaviſh to the World, and Rude to a Stranger.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:136998:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> I am ſorry a Man who <hi>deals in Books</hi> ſhould diſcover his Wit to be ſo little, or his Neceſſity ſo great, as to force him to the uſe of ſuch unpracticable Meaſures, which every Prudent Author ought to Condemn, and every Honeſt Bookſeller Deteſt.</p>
            <p>Tho' the little ſhallow-brain'd Lampooneer (who could never before now extend his Muſhroon Fancy above Balla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian height) hath fooliſhly ſuffer'd himſelf, in a Dtunken Freak, to be carry'd beyond his Tallent; and venture, like an unskilful Swimmer, to wade out of his depth at his own peril: Yet, I thought, the Bookſeller might have had more wit, than to Record himſelf ſuch a PUPPY in Print; and lend himſelf to his Author, to uſe him as the worſt piece of Rubbiſh of which he has compos'd his Dunghill of Reflections. I muſt confeſs, till now, I could not think there was ſuch a Cocks-comb of the Trade.</p>
            <p>The Author, in his filthy Quagmire of Nonſenſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the <hi>Weſt-India Poet</hi> to be a Tranſport Fellon: But I am ſure the <hi>Dutch Obſervator,</hi> in his pretended <hi>Trip to Holland,</hi> (patch'd up of as many bits and ſnips, and appears of as many Colours as a Fools Jacket) hath openly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a ſhameful piece of <hi>Theft,</hi> that he deſerves Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation into an <hi>Iſland of Fools,</hi> where he ſhould have no oppertunity of playing the <hi>Ape</hi> with any above the Curſe of his own Capacity.</p>
            <p>I would adviſe him for the future, to confine his Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Obſcene Dialect within its proper bounds; and never preſume to attempt any thing beyond a <hi>Bloody Murther, Bawdy Ballad,</hi> or a <hi>Laſt Dying Speech and Confeſſion.</hi> And I muſt needs take the liberty of giving him this Caution, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he wipes the Bird-lime off his Fingers, that they may no more ſtick to a Silver Tankard, or draw Books after them into <hi>Duck-Lane,</hi> to the diſgrace of his Family, and ſcandal of the Purchaſers, he may chance to fall into the hands of as ſcurvy a Poetaſter as himſelf; and become the lamentable Subject of a doleful Ditty.</p>
            <p>I hear, within two or three days, there will an Anſwer be Publiſh'd, as a check to his upſtart Inſolence. Who it is that thinks it worth their Labour I know not: I declare to the World it's none of mine, for I ſhall give my ſelf no other trouble than this, without a further Provocation: But aſſure the Bookſeller I'll not forget his kindneſs; and as for the Author, if this gentle Correction mend not his manners, the next ſhall be a Cudgel.</p>
